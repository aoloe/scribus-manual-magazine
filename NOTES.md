There are some "templates" around for Scribus but they're not - what I would call - "real" templates as they have no more functionality that any normal document has. Scribus templates are, essentially, just Scribus documents that have a different file type. Most templates that are available aren't very good. For the few that are good, most of them are for very specific things so you're unlikely to find something that's good for what you want.

Also, there are so many different types of articles in New Scientist. Do you want something simple like these: http://cargocollective.com/justtomtom/New-Scientist-Illustrations or something more creative like these: http://mwmgraphics.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/new-scientist-cover-feature-art.html

There is no such thing as a "standard" magazine article, even within the same magazine. If there was, the magazine would be a very boring read.

Your best bet is to do it yourself from scratch. I realise that might seem like a tall order but it's the best way to learn and it's not that difficult to get something basic but usable.

You could start by finding an article you like and then roughly drawing the different parts of the page in Scribus. For example, draw text frames where there is some text and draw image frames where there are images. They don't need to be exact, just get them roughly in the right place. Don't worry about text columns just yet.

Then you can look at where frames might line up. Create guides where you think they should line up and drag/resize the frames to match the guides. You can always move the guides and re-align the frames later if you want to.

Then you can start to add sample text to the text frames and random/dummy images into the image frames.

Then you can look at text columns. Find a text frame and change the number of columns until it looks about right. Then change the font and size to roughly match the original example.

Once you've got to this point you've made a big start on designing your own article.

Now you can start to think about adding other "furniture" to the page such as page numbers and other graphical devices.

Once you start learning how to use Scribus properly - rather than just inserting images and text into other people's templates - it will allow you to create anything you want.
